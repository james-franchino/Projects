# Prosper Loan Exploration
## by James Franchino


## Dataset

> This data set contains 113937 rows, with 81 columns containing information about loans made through Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending platform. For the purpose of this analysis, I'm using the following columns: 'Term', 'LoanStatus', 'BorrowerRate', 'ProsperRating (Alpha)', 'ListingCategory (numeric)', 'EmploymentStatus', 'DelinquenciesLast7Years', 'StatedMonthlyIncome', 'TotalProsperLoans', 'LoanOriginalAmount', 'LoanOriginationDate', 'Recommendations', 'Investors'.


## Summary of Findings

> The vast majority of loans through Prosper are current. Meaning that they are currently being paid off as per the terms agreed to. The second biggest category of loans are completed loans, loans that have been paid off in full.

> The most common loan length (term) is 36 months, or three years.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> Term length and Prosper Rating:
We can see that the most popular length of time for a loan is 36 months, regardless of Prosper Rating.
